**A lightweight, GPU-accelerated capture card viewer for Windows and Linux.** No recording, no bloat, just your game on your screen.

Built for capture cards like the Genki ShadowCast, Elgato, AVerMedia, and other UVC-compliant devices. Written in Rust with a zero-copy GPU pipeline and low-latency audio passthrough.

## Features

- **GPU-accelerated rendering** via wgpu with a custom YUV-to-RGB shader
- **NVIDIA GPU MJPEG decode** via nvJPEG/CUDA (automatic fallback to software decode)
- **Zero-copy GPU pipeline** - decoded frames never leave the GPU (CUDA to DX12 to wgpu)
- **Low-latency audio passthrough** via WASAPI (Windows) and PipeWire / ALSA (Linux)
- **Robust audio resampling & channel conversion** - handles mono, stereo, and variable sample rates (e.g. PS4/PS5/Switch audio over USB capture cards)
- **Audio mute toggle & UI status** - mute control with real-time audio connection status
- **Cross-platform video capture** - DirectShow on Windows, V4L2 on Linux
- **Resolution options** - 720p, 1080p, 1440p, 4K
- **FPS modes** - 30, 60, 120, or Custom (30-240)
- **Live FPS counter** with real measured framerate
- **Auto-detect capture cards** via DirectShow and V4L2
- **Dark theme UI** with pause-style settings menu (egui)
- **Fullscreen support** (F11 or toggle in settings)
- **Zero recording overhead** - purely a viewer
- **Settings persistence** - remembers your device selections
- **Diagnostic logging** - rotating log files for troubleshooting

## Quick Start

1. Download the latest release from [Releases](../../releases)
   - **Windows**: Download `TackleCast-Windows-x86_64.zip`, extract anywhere, and double-click `TackleCast.exe`.
   - **Linux**: Download `TackleCast-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz`, extract (`tar -xzvf TackleCast-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz`), and run `./run.sh`.

No additional software required.

## Building from Source

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for full build instructions.

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Controls

| Action | Key |
|---|---|
| Open/close settings | Escape |
| Fullscreen | F11 |

## How It Works

TackleCast has a three-tier decode pipeline that automatically selects the best path for your hardware:

| Tier | Path | When |
|---|---|---|
| Zero-copy | nvJPEG decode to shared DX12 buffer to wgpu | NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (Windows) |
| GPU decode + readback | nvJPEG decode to host memory to wgpu | CUDA available, DX12 interop unavailable |
| Software decode | ffmpeg CPU decode to wgpu | Linux or no CUDA/nvJPEG available |

At 60 FPS and below, most capture cards output raw NV12 with zero decode overhead. Above 60 FPS, MJPEG is used and benefits from GPU decode.

## Architecture

```
src/
  main.rs          - winit event loop, app state, settings
  capture.rs       - DirectShow / V4L2 capture via ffmpeg-next, format/resolution fallback
  gpu_decode.rs    - NVIDIA nvJPEG GPU MJPEG decode (feature-gated: gpu-decode)
  dx12_interop.rs  - DX12 shared buffers for CUDA/wgpu zero-copy (feature-gated: gpu-decode)
  render.rs        - wgpu DX12/Vulkan renderer, YUV->RGB WGSL shader
  audio/           - Audio passthrough via cpal (WASAPI on Windows, PipeWire/ALSA on Linux)
  devices.rs       - Cross-platform video + audio device enumeration
  settings.rs      - JSON settings load/save
  ui.rs            - egui overlay and settings menu
  logger.rs        - Rotating file logger via tracing
```

## Known Limitations

- **GPU decode is NVIDIA-only** (AMD AMF and Intel Quick Sync planned for a future release). Non-NVIDIA GPUs fall back to software decode automatically.
- **Some capture cards may throttle at high framerates.** Smaller USB passthrough dongles (e.g. Genki ShadowCast 2 Pro) can thermally throttle their internal MJPEG encoder at sustained 1440p@120fps, causing frame delivery to drop to ~60fps. This is a hardware limitation, not a software issue. Devices with better thermal design (e.g. ShadowCast 3) are unaffected.
- Laptop GPUs may thermal throttle at sustained 4K@60fps or 1440p@120fps (a cooling pad helps).
- Webcams may partially work but are not officially supported.
